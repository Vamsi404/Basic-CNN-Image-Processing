# Basic-CNN-Image-Processing
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook demonstrating basic image processing and a custom implementation of convolution, a core operation in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Learn how to load, preprocess, and visualize images while exploring how CNNs extract features from raw data.
