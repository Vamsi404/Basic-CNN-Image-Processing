# Basic CNN Image Processing

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates basic image processing and custom convolution operations, a key component in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This project is ideal for beginners exploring the fundamentals of CNNs and how they process image data.

## 🌟 Features

- **📷 Image Loading & Preprocessing:** Learn how to load, resize, and convert images for further processing.
- **🧠 Custom Convolution Implementation:** Explore a step-by-step guide on implementing the convolution operation from scratch.
- **🔍 Image Visualization:** Visualize images before and after applying filters to understand how feature extraction works.
